### Using the code example with a ModusToolbox IDE:

1. Import the project: **File** > **Import...** > **General** > **Existing Projects into Workspace** > **Next**.
2. Select the directory where **"RutDevKit-PSoC62_Hello_World"** resides and click  **Finish**.
3. Select and build the project **Project ** > **Build Project**.
